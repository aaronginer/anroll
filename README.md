## Usage

For each type of input available in the UI, there is appropriate sample data in the samples package above.

If you use the "Model" option, make sure the camera looks down the up axis of the vessel (top view) and that it is well centered.

The image editor options lets you remove handles or other artifacts when necessary.

Using the "Project" options is simplest to get a quick look at the software and it's features.
