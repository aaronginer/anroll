1.0.2


User:
- added a resolution slider for cylindrical unrolling of models
- updated scale of radius modifier to be perfectly rolled up at 1 (Curvature Radius = Unrolling Radius)

Dev:
- increased websocket max message size to server to maximum
- fixed error calculation for optimization
- switched to analytical calculation of IFCurve's "a" parameter.
- fixed blending bug when error image and unrolling would not have the same vertical dimensions
- replaced EF Spline with integral on-the-fly calculations (slightly slower, but more intuitive)
- various small adjustments

1.0.3

User:
- adjusted color-mapping for angular error to display deviation in both directions, and angle measurements are done away from the central axis
- region of interest selection now only rotates the image if the chosen vertical/horizontal crop is too small.
- renamed parameters to fit with paper designations (d-Factor->Uniformity, Radius Modifier -> Radius Factor)
- Added option to change output resolution
- Added option to also export the mask and cylindrical unrolling
- Added option to shift the texture vertically to adjust for minor mask misalignments
- Added model unrolling ambient light control
- Added option to fill up the input mask (done automatically upon project start)

Dev:
- fixed distortion map alignment
- fixed y-range of IFCurve Plot
- model initial cylinder unrolling now with transparent background
- Error -> Distortion rename
- fixed bug unrolling models (mixing of inside and outside texture)
- Model viewer camera position now based on model size to avoid clipping
- Fixed model unrolling error (coordinate clipping with camera plane)
- Changed default texture background to white.

1.0.4

User:
- [App] Ctrl+R opens window allowing server restart in case of a port overload.

Dev:
- [App] Ctrl+T opens console
- Fixed mask loading issue introduced by automatic mask filling

1.0.5 (Public Release)
User:
- Uniformity can now interpolate the entire range of possible values (including extreme deformation), unless "Restrict"ed by the user.
- [App] Ctrl+O let's users switch between online and offline mode (online mode imbeds the latest version of the UI from the AnRoll website)

Dev:
- Changed calculation of beta_U bounds - is now based on vertical texture resolution and the bounds definitions defined in Appendix A of the paper.
